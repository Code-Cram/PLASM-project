I start the project in the train. I spend like an hour thinking and making the logdev.

### Added logdev.txt

## [0.0.2] - 28-01-2026
Adding more context of the project and starting to think about the programming structure.

### Changed logdev.txt
I add to the logdev the main structure of the project in seven phases. I made the structure with AI telling all my ideas and describing the whole project. So, rigth now I have the idea of the project and the programming structure.
